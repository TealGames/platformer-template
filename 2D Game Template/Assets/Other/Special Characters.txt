Special C# characters:

@ symbol before string means to ignore escape characters ('\')
ex. @"Bob said: "Hey"" will treat every character as a literal

@ symbol could also used for variable names to use C# keywords as var names
ex. var @switch= true;
    var @if= 1;

? symbol is used to check null variables (*Commonly used in C# events)
ex. animator?.SetTrigger("attack_trig"); is the same as:
    if (animator!=null) animator.SetTrigger("attack_trig");

? symbol could also be used to check simple if statements (plus using it to assign values to vars)
ex. (!hasAttacked)? Attack() : return; which is the same as:
    if (!hasAttacked) Attack();
    else return;
ex. bool isSwitchOn= (state== State.On)? true: false;

# symbol can be used to write messages to the compiler
ex. private void Function()
    #region Declaration
    { // do stuff...
    }
    #end_region
